# Introduction

 On average 211,000 people in the UK go hiking every year. Of these 9.5% reported injuries and
15% of these injuries were fatal. According to the Swiss Alpine club, the number of deaths due to
mountain sport rose by 48% in 2016, and is at its highest since 2011. It is critical that rescue teams
reach mountaineers within a reasonable time limits, and safely transport patients to the nearest
medical centre.
1) Coming up with an interesting planning domain and instances.
 Our planner simulates a Flight & Rescue simulator. We would simulate mountain hikers who need
to be rescued from a mountain. This scenario works well as minimising the rescue time is key. An
effective planner would save both lives and money. This scenario allows us to experiment with a rich
domain, as well as durative actions.
